## Issues

[Open an issue](https://github.com/phramusca/JaMuz/issues?state=open) for anything you would like to see in JaMuz, but please check other issues first.

## Internationalization

Using [weblate.org](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/jamuz/)

- If you plan to update the bundle**.properties files, please remember that such files are ISO 8859-1 encoded.
- Using a different encoding may certainly result in weird characters in the GUI
- ie: NO UTF-8 nor anything else
(NetBeans respect the convention, but other editors may use instead UTF-8 for instance, the most common default encoding)

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome.
Please submit to the `master` branch.
